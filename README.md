# crop-n-gif

I miss LICEcap for mac, it doesn’t work anymore on catalina and beyond and doesn’t look like they will fix it. Basically, it lets you take a screencap and save as a gif very easily.

So instead I’m now using a combination of the built-in screen recording and this ffmpeg script

You can take a screen recording with cmd-shift-5 and either record the whole screen or an area. Then you put that movie thorough the script and you can crop it further and convert to gif.
